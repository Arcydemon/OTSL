20:29 Santiago: Hello Zekir Baara, nice to see you on Rookgaard! I saw you walking by and wondered if you could help me. Could you? Please, say {yes}!
20:29 Zekir Baara [1]: no
20:29 Santiago: That's quite sad. You won't have to do it for free though. You'll get a nice reward and even a weapon. Come on, say yes!
20:30 Zekir Baara [1]: bye (byle co)
20:30 Santiago: I'll give you a hint. Those highlighted words are keywords that will always keep a conversation going. Usually you can also answer with yes or no.
20:31 Zekir Baara [1]: yes
20:31 Santiago: Ah, thank you so much. To keep talking to me, either use the highlighted keywords or answer with 'yes' or 'no'. Listen, I have a little cockroach problem, but I think you need some proper equipment first, right?
20:31 Zekir Baara [1]: no
20:31 Santiago: Oh, but look at yourself. You can't fight like that! Go to my house. Upstairs, you'll find a chest. You can keep what you find inside of it! Come back after you got it. {Yes}?
20:32 Zekir Baara [1]: no
20:32 Santiago: Psst. This is the part where you say '{yes}'! Never refuse free items!
(walkaway xD)
20:33 Zekir Baara [1]: hi
20:33 Santiago: Oh, Zekir Baara, it's you again! It's probably impolite to disturb a busy adventurer like you, but I really need help. Please, say {yes}!
20:34 Zekir Baara [1]: yes
20:34 Santiago: Ah, thank you so much. To keep talking to me, either use the {highlighted} keywords or answer with '{yes}' or '{no}'. Listen, I have a little cockroach problem, but I think you need some proper equipment first, {right}?
20:34 Zekir Baara [1]: highlighted
20:34 Santiago: Yes, you got it. So, about that equipment - we need to get you dressed, {right}?
20:36 Zekir Baara [1]: right
20:36 Santiago: Great, please go to my house, just a few steps south of here. Upstairs in my room, you'll find a chest. You can keep what you find inside of it! Come back after you got it and greet me to talk to me again. {Yes}?

20:49 Zekir Baara [1]: no
20:49 Santiago: Please, I have no choice. I need a strong fighter like you. I'm simply too afraid to go down there. Please say 'yes'!
